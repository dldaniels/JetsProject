### Jet Project

### Overview
The Jet Project will keep a list of jets and allow multiple different options displayed to the user. Upon starting the user will see a menu displaying numbered options. The user enters the corresponding number for each option to access that option. This method is implemented throughout the duration of the program in all menus. The user will be able to view a list of pre installed jets, select an option to fly all jets, view the jet with the top speed, view the jet with the farthest range capabilities, add a custom jet to the list, remove any jet of their choice from the list, and quit the program. In addition to these options the user will also have access to type specific behaviors for jets such as fighter jets and cargo jets.

### Lessons Learned
This project really hammered home the importance of UML and prior planning. I thought I had learned this lesson on the previous project. I started off strong with the UML diagram at first but began to get a little to comfortable and starting going off script with excitement for other parts. This quickly led to confusion. Once I realized what was happening I was able to get back on track but some time was certainly lost. I found the use of the ArrayLists to be awesome. I really enjoyed the simplicity of it as compared to regular arrays. Through the use of subclasses and interfaces i really enjoyed the different possibilities of what one could do with OOP in Java and am actually kind of disappointed thats this project is over. Like the excitement of eating a taco but the dissapointment of seeing the plate empty.
